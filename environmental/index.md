# Environmental (E)

**Framework**: 9 Planetary Boundaries

The environmental pillar is organized around the **Planetary Boundaries** framework developed by the Stockholm Resilience Centre. This science-based framework defines nine Earth system thresholds that maintain a safe operating space for humanity.

## What Are Planetary Boundaries?

Planetary Boundaries represent critical limits in Earth's systems. Crossing these boundaries increases the risk of irreversible environmental changes that could destabilize ecosystems and human societies.

**Framework Origin**: Rockström et al. (2009), updated 2023  
**Scientific Basis**: Earth system science, tipping points analysis  
**Status**: 6 of 9 boundaries currently transgressed

## The 9 Planetary Boundaries

### PB1. [Climate Change](/environmental/climate-change/)
**Status**: Boundary transgressed  
**Control Variable**: Atmospheric CO₂ concentration (currently 420 ppm; boundary: 350 ppm)  
**Business Impact**: Physical risks (extreme weather, sea-level rise); transition risks (carbon pricing, stranded assets)

### PB2. [Biodiversity Loss](/environmental/biodiversity/)
**Status**: Boundary transgressed  
**Control Variable**: Genetic diversity & functional diversity  
**Business Impact**: Supply chain disruption, ecosystem service degradation, regulatory risk

### PB3. [Land-System Change](/environmental/land-system/)
**Status**: Boundary transgressed  
**Control Variable**: Forest cover as % of original extent  
**Business Impact**: Agricultural productivity, carbon sequestration capacity, indigenous rights

### PB4. [Freshwater Use](/environmental/freshwater/)
**Status**: Boundary transgressed (green water)  
**Control Variable**: Blue water (surface/ground) and green water (soil moisture)  
**Business Impact**: Water stress, operational constraints, community conflict

### PB5. [Biogeochemical Flows](/environmental/biogeochemical/)
**Status**: Boundary transgressed (nitrogen & phosphorus)  
**Control Variable**: N & P flows to oceans and terrestrial systems  
**Business Impact**: Eutrophication, agricultural input costs, regulatory constraints

### PB6. [Ocean Acidification](/environmental/ocean-acidification/)
**Status**: Within boundary (but approaching)  
**Control Variable**: Aragonite saturation state  
**Business Impact**: Fisheries collapse, coastal community impacts, supply chain risks

### PB7. [Atmospheric Aerosol Loading](/environmental/aerosol-loading/)
**Status**: Boundary not yet quantified  
**Control Variable**: Particulate matter concentration  
**Business Impact**: Air quality regulations, health impacts, operational licenses

### PB8. [Stratospheric Ozone Depletion](/environmental/ozone-depletion/)
**Status**: Within boundary (Montreal Protocol success)  
**Control Variable**: Stratospheric O₃ concentration  
**Business Impact**: Regulatory compliance, chemical substitution

### PB9. [Novel Entities](/environmental/novel-entities/)
**Status**: Boundary transgressed  
**Control Variable**: Introduction of novel substances (plastics, chemicals, GMOs)  
**Business Impact**: Extended producer responsibility, circular economy mandates, plastic taxes

## Why This Framework for ESG?

The Planetary Boundaries framework provides:

- **Science-based thresholds**: Objective limits grounded in Earth system science
- **Systemic perspective**: Interconnections between environmental issues
- **Risk quantification**: Clear metrics for crossing tipping points
- **Alignment with disclosure standards**: TNFD, ESRS E1-E5, GRI 300 series
