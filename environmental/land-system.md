# Land-System Change
**Planetary Boundary 3**

## Boundary Status

**Status**: Boundary transgressed  
**Control Variable**: Forest cover as % of original forest extent  
- **Current**: 62% of original forest cover remaining  
- **Boundary**: 75% for boreal and temperate forests; 85% for tropical forests

**Scientific Basis**: Land-system change affects climate regulation, water cycles, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Deforestation accounts for ~10% of global GHG emissions. Tropical forests alone store 250 Gt of carbon.

## Business Relevance

### Direct Impacts
- **Agriculture**: Land conversion for crops and livestock
- **Forestry**: Logging, pulp and paper production
- **Real Estate**: Urban expansion and infrastructure
- **Mining**: Land disturbance and habitat fragmentation

### Supply Chain Risks
- **Commodity Sourcing**: Palm oil, soy, beef, timber (deforestation-linked)
- **Regulatory Risk**: EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), UK Due Diligence Act
- **Reputational Risk**: NGO campaigns, consumer boycotts
- **Operational Risk**: Indigenous land rights conflicts

## Key Standards & Frameworks

### Disclosure Standards
- **[TNFD](/standards/tnfd/)** — Land use change in LEAP assessment
- **[EU ESRS E4](/standards/esrs/)** — Biodiversity and ecosystems (includes land use)
- **[GRI 304](/standards/gri/)** — Biodiversity (includes habitat protection)
- **[CDP Forests](/standards/climate-nature/cdp/)** — Deforestation disclosure questionnaire

### Regulatory Frameworks
- **[EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en)** — Prohibits import of commodities linked to deforestation (effective 2024)
- **[UK Environment Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/30/contents)** — Due diligence on forest-risk commodities

## Recommended Metrics

### Deforestation Metrics
- **Land Conversion Rate**: Hectares per year converted from natural ecosystems
- **Forest Cover Change**: Net change in forest area (ha)
- **Zero-Deforestation Commitment**: % of supply chain certified deforestation-free

### Restoration Metrics
- **Land Restored**: Hectares of degraded land restored
- **Reforestation Rate**: Trees planted or regenerated
- **Biodiversity Recovery**: Species richness on restored land

### Supply Chain Metrics
- **Traceability**: % of high-risk commodities traceable to origin
- **Certification**: % of sourcing from certified sustainable sources (FSC, RSPO, etc.)

---

## High-Risk Commodities

**Agriculture-driven deforestation commodities**:
- Cattle (beef and leather)
- Soy
- Palm oil
- Cocoa
- Coffee
- Rubber
- Timber and pulp
