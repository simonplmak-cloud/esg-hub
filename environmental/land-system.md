# Land-System Change

**Planetary Boundary 3** | Status: **Boundary Transgressed**

---

## Boundary Definition

**Control Variable**: % of global land surface converted to cropland

**Safe Operating Space**: Maintain 75% of original forest cover in major biomes

**Current Status**: 
- Global forest cover: 62% of original (**transgressed**)
- Tropical forests: 85% remaining
- Temperate forests: 50% remaining
- Boreal forests: 85% remaining

**Source**: [Richardson et al. (2023)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh2458)

## Why This Matters

Land-system change (deforestation, agricultural expansion, urbanization) drives biodiversity loss, disrupts water cycles, reduces carbon storage, and alters regional climates. Forests store ~45% of terrestrial carbon and provide habitat for 80% of terrestrial species.

**Key Drivers**:
- Agriculture expansion (commodity crops: soy, palm oil, beef)
- Urbanization
- Infrastructure development
- Logging (legal and illegal)
