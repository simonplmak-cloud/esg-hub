# Freshwater Use
**Planetary Boundary 4**

## Boundary Status

**Status**: Boundary transgressed (green water)  
**Control Variables**:  
- **Blue water** (surface and groundwater): Within boundary globally, but transgressed regionally  
- **Green water** (soil moisture): Boundary transgressed

**Scientific Basis**: Freshwater sustains ecosystems and human societies. Only 2.5% of Earth's water is fresh, and only 0.3% is accessible. Water stress affects 2 billion people. Agriculture consumes 70% of global freshwater withdrawals.

## Business Relevance

### Water-Intensive Sectors
- **Agriculture**: Irrigation (70% of global water use)
- **Energy**: Thermoelectric cooling, hydropower
- **Manufacturing**: Textiles, chemicals, food processing, semiconductors
- **Mining**: Ore processing, dust suppression
- **Beverages**: Bottling, brewing

### Water-related Risks
- **Physical Scarcity**: Insufficient water for operations
- **Regulatory**: Water withdrawal permits, discharge limits
- **Reputational**: Community conflicts over water access
- **Financial**: Water pricing, infrastructure costs

## Recommended Metrics

### Water Consumption
- **Total Water Withdrawal**: Megaliters per year (ML/year)
- **Water Consumption**: ML consumed (not returned to source)
- **Water Intensity**: ML per unit of production or per $M revenue

### Water Stress
- **Baseline Water Stress**: Withdrawal as % of available supply (WRI Aqueduct)
- **Operations in High-Stress Areas**: % of facilities in regions with baseline water stress >40%

### Water Quality
- **Effluent Discharge**: Volume and quality (BOD, COD, heavy metals)
- **Wastewater Treatment**: % of wastewater treated to regulatory standards

### Water Footprint
- **Blue Water Footprint**: Surface and groundwater consumption
- **Green Water Footprint**: Rainwater consumption (agriculture)
- **Grey Water Footprint**: Volume needed to dilute pollutants
