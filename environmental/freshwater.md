# Freshwater Use

**Planetary Boundary 4** | Status: **Within Boundary (Global), Transgressed Regionally**

---

## Boundary Definition

**Control Variables**:
- **Blue water**: Consumptive use of surface/groundwater (km³/year)
- **Green water**: Soil moisture for plant growth (% of original flow)

**Safe Operating Space**:
- Blue water: 4,000 km³/year
- Green water: <10% deviation from natural flow at basin level

**Current Status**:
- Blue water: ~2,600 km³/year globally (**within boundary**)
- Regional: Many basins transgressed (e.g., Yellow River, Colorado River, Aral Sea)
- Green water: Significant alteration in agricultural regions (**transgressed in some areas**)

## Why This Matters

Freshwater sustains ecosystems and human societies. While global consumption is within safe limits, regional water stress affects 4 billion people for at least one month per year. Agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater withdrawals.

**Key Risks**:
- Groundwater depletion (aquifer overdraft)
- River flow disruption
- Ecosystem degradation (wetlands, estuaries)
- Water-energy-food nexus conflicts

## Measurement Metrics

### Water Footprint Components
- **Blue water footprint**: Surface/groundwater consumption
- **Green water footprint**: Rainwater consumed by crops
- **Grey water footprint**: Pollution assimilation capacity

### Water Stress Indicators
- **Baseline Water Stress**: Withdrawals / available supply
- **Water Depletion**: Consumption / available supply
- **Interannual Variability**: Year-to-year fluctuation
