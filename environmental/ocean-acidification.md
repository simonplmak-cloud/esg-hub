# Ocean Acidification
**Planetary Boundary 6**

## Boundary Status

**Status**: Within boundary (but approaching threshold)  
**Control Variable**: Aragonite saturation state (Ωarag)  
- **Current**: Ωarag ≈ 2.8 (global mean)  
- **Boundary**: Ωarag ≥ 2.75

**Scientific Basis**: Ocean absorbs ~25% of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions, forming carbonic acid and lowering pH. Ocean pH has decreased 0.1 units since pre-industrial times (30% increase in acidity). Continued acidification threatens marine ecosystems, particularly calcifying organisms (corals, shellfish, plankton).

## Business Relevance

### Directly Impacted Sectors
- **Fisheries**: Shellfish collapse, food web disruption
- **Aquaculture**: Oyster, mussel, and clam farming
- **Tourism**: Coral reef degradation
- **Coastal Communities**: Loss of natural coastal protection
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Marine-derived compounds

### Economic Impacts
- **US Pacific Northwest**: Oyster larvae die-offs linked to acidification (2007-2009 crisis)
- **Global Fisheries**: $100B+ industry dependent on marine ecosystems
- **Coral Reefs**: $375B annual economic value (tourism, fisheries, coastal protection)

## Recommended Metrics

### Emissions-based
- **CO₂ Emissions**: Total Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions (driver of acidification)
- **Emissions Reduction Targets**: SBTi-validated 1.5°C pathway

### Ocean Dependency
- **Revenue from Marine Resources**: % dependent on ocean health
- **Supply Chain Ocean Dependency**: Seafood sourcing, seaweed, marine ingredients

### Impact Mitigation
- **Blue Carbon Projects**: Mangrove/seagrass restoration
- **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**: Support or investment in MPAs
- **Sustainable Seafood**: % certified (MSC, ASC)

## Root Cause

**Ocean acidification is directly caused by CO₂ emissions.** Unlike other planetary boundaries, there is no separate "ocean acidification footprint"—it is a climate change impact. Mitigation requires:

1. **Decarbonization**: Reduce CO₂ emissions (SBTi targets)
2. **Blue Carbon**: Restore coastal ecosystems (mangroves, seagrass, salt marshes)
3. **Ecosystem Resilience**: Reduce other stressors (overfishing, pollution)
