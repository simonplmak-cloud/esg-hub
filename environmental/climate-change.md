# Climate Change
**Planetary Boundary 1**

## Boundary Status

**Status**: Boundary transgressed  
**Control Variables**:  
- Atmospheric CO₂ concentration: 420 ppm (boundary: 350 ppm)  
- Energy imbalance at top of atmosphere: +2.3 W/m² (boundary: +1.0 W/m²)

**Scientific Basis**: Climate change drives global temperature rise, extreme weather, sea-level rise, and ecosystem disruption. Current trajectory: 2.7°C warming by 2100 under current policies.

---

## Business Relevance

### Physical Risks
- **Acute**: Extreme weather (floods, hurricanes, wildfires, droughts)
- **Chronic**: Sea-level rise, temperature shifts, precipitation pattern changes

### Transition Risks
- **Policy**: Carbon pricing, emissions regulations, mandatory disclosure
- **Technology**: Shift to renewables, EV adoption, energy efficiency
- **Market**: Changing consumer preferences, green premiums
- **Reputation**: Climate litigation, activist pressure, brand perception

## Key Standards & Frameworks

### Disclosure Standards
- **[IFRS S2](/standards/ifrs-s1-s2/)** — Climate-related disclosures (effective 2024)
- **[TCFD](/standards/tcfd/)** — Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
- **[EU ESRS E1](/standards/esrs/)** — Climate change (double materiality)
- **[GRI 305](/standards/gri/)** — Emissions

### Measurement & Target-Setting
- **[GHG Protocol](/standards/climate-nature/ghg-protocol/)** — Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1, 2, 3)
- **[SBTi](/standards/climate-nature/sbti/)** — Science Based Targets initiative (1.5°C pathway)
- **[CDP Climate](/standards/climate-nature/cdp/)** — Climate disclosure questionnaire
- **[PCAF](/standards/climate-nature/pcaf/)** — Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (financed emissions)

## Recommended Metrics

### GHG Emissions
- **Scope 1**: Direct emissions (tCO₂e)
- **Scope 2**: Purchased electricity (location-based & market-based)
- **Scope 3**: Value chain emissions (15 categories)

### Financial Metrics
- **Carbon Intensity**: tCO₂e per $M revenue
- **Climate VaR**: Value at risk from climate scenarios
- **Transition Cost**: Capital expenditure for decarbonization

### Scenario Analysis
- **IEA Scenarios**: Net Zero 2050, Announced Pledges, Current Policies
- **NGFS Scenarios**: Orderly, disorderly, hot house world
- **IPCC SSP Scenarios**: SSP1-1.9 to SSP5-8.5
