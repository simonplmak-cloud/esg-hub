# Novel Entities
**Planetary Boundary 9**

## Boundary Status

**Status**: Boundary transgressed  
**Control Variable**: Not yet fully quantified (complexity: >350,000 chemicals registered)  
**Qualitative Assessment**: Pollution from plastics, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), endocrine disruptors, heavy metals, nanomaterials, GMOs exceeds safe limits

**Scientific Basis**: Novel entities include synthetic chemicals, plastics, GMOs, nanomaterials, and other anthropogenic substances that have no natural analogs. Many persist in the environment, bioaccumulate, and cause chronic health and ecosystem harm. Microplastics now found in human blood, placenta, and every ecosystem on Earth.

## Business Relevance

### Key Novel Entity Categories

**1. Plastics**  
- **Scale**: 460 Mt produced annually (2019); 8 Mt enter oceans/year  
- **Business Impact**: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), plastic taxes, single-use bans  

**2. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)**  
- **Examples**: PCBs, dioxins, PFAS ("forever chemicals")  
- **Business Impact**: Product bans, contamination liability, remediation costs  

**3. Heavy Metals**  
- **Examples**: Lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic  
- **Business Impact**: Exposure limits, electronics recycling mandates (e-waste)  

**4. Endocrine Disruptors**  
- **Examples**: BPA, phthalates, parabens  
- **Business Impact**: Chemical restrictions in consumer products  

**5. Nanomaterials**  
- **Examples**: Carbon nanotubes, nanosilver, titanium dioxide nanoparticles  
- **Business Impact**: Emerging regulation (EU REACH nanomaterials annex)

## Recommended Metrics

### Plastics
- **Plastic Packaging Used**: Tonnes per year
- **Recycled Content**: % of packaging from recycled materials
- **Single-Use Plastic Elimination**: Tonnes reduced
- **Plastic Footprint**: Tonnes leaked to environment

### Chemicals
- **Substances of Concern (SoC)**: Number of chemicals on restriction lists used
- **REACH Compliance**: % of chemicals pre-registered
- **Chemical Intensity**: kg chemicals used per unit output

### Hazardous Waste
- **Hazardous Waste Generated**: Tonnes per year
- **% Safely Disposed**: Compliant disposal/treatment
- **E-waste Recycling Rate**: % of electronics responsibly recycled

## Circular Economy Approaches

**Design Strategies**:
- **Eliminate**: Phase out unnecessary chemicals and plastics
- **Substitute**: Replace hazardous substances with safer alternatives
- **Reduce**: Minimize material use
- **Reuse**: Design for multiple lifecycles
- **Recycle**: Close material loops
