# Atmospheric Aerosol Loading
**Planetary Boundary 7**

## Boundary Status

**Status**: Boundary not yet quantified globally  
**Control Variable**: Particulate matter (PM) concentration (regional measurement)  
- **Regional Boundary**: Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) varies by region  
- **Note**: South Asian monsoon region identified as high risk

**Scientific Basis**: Atmospheric aerosols (particulate matter, soot, dust, sulfates) affect climate, human health, and ecosystems. Sources include fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, industrial emissions, and natural dust. High aerosol loading alters precipitation patterns and causes respiratory diseases.

## Business Relevance

### Directly Impacted Sectors
- **Energy**: Coal and oil combustion (PM2.5, black carbon)
- **Transportation**: Diesel exhaust, tire wear
- **Manufacturing**: Industrial processes (cement, steel, chemicals)
- **Agriculture**: Biomass burning, ammonia emissions
- **Construction**: Dust generation

### Health & Regulatory Risks
- **Air Quality Regulations**: PM2.5 and PM10 limits (WHO, EPA, EU)
- **Health Impacts**: 7 million premature deaths annually from air pollution (WHO)
- **Operational Constraints**: Emission permits, pollution controls
- **Litigation**: Air quality non-compliance penalties

## Key Standards & Frameworks

### Air Quality Standards
- **[WHO Air Quality Guidelines (2021)](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines)** — PM2.5: 5 μg/m³ annual mean
- **[US EPA NAAQS](https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table)** — National Ambient Air Quality Standards
- **[EU Air Quality Directive](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/air/air-quality/eu-air-quality-standards_en)** — PM2.5 and PM10 limits

### Disclosure Standards
- **[GRI 305](/standards/gri/)** — Emissions (includes air pollutants beyond GHGs)
- **[EU ESRS E2](/standards/esrs/)** — Pollution (includes air quality)

## Recommended Metrics

### Emissions Metrics
- **PM2.5 Emissions**: Tonnes per year (particulate matter <2.5 μm)
- **PM10 Emissions**: Tonnes per year (particulate matter <10 μm)
- **Black Carbon**: Tonnes per year (soot)
- **Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)**: Tonnes per year (sulfate aerosol precursor)
- **Nitrogen Oxides (NOₓ)**: Tonnes per year (nitrate aerosol precursor)

### Ambient Air Quality
- **PM2.5 Concentration**: μg/m³ (annual mean at facility perimeter)
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Daily monitoring

### Control Technology
- **Emission Control Systems**: Scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, baghouses
- **% of Facilities with Advanced Controls**: Coverage rate

---

## Health Impacts

**WHO Estimates (2021)**:
- **7 million premature deaths** annually from ambient and household air pollution
- **4.2 million deaths** from ambient (outdoor) PM2.5 exposure
- **Diseases**: Ischemic heart disease, stroke, COPD, lung cancer
