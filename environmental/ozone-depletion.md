# Stratospheric Ozone Depletion
**Planetary Boundary 8**

## Boundary Status

**Status**: Within boundary ✓  
**Control Variable**: Stratospheric ozone concentration  
- **Current**: Recovering (Antarctic ozone hole shrinking)  
- **Boundary**: <5% reduction from pre-industrial O₃ concentration

**Scientific Basis**: The stratospheric ozone layer protects Earth from harmful UV radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) caused the Antarctic ozone hole (discovered 1985). The **Montreal Protocol (1987)** is the most successful environmental treaty, phasing out ODS globally. Ozone layer is now recovering and expected to return to 1980 levels by 2066.

## Business Relevance

### Historical Context
- **CFCs**: Used in refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosol propellants, solvents (1930s-1990s)
- **Montreal Protocol Success**: 99% of ODS phased out globally
- **Kigali Amendment (2016)**: Phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—ozone-safe but potent GHGs

### Current Business Impacts
- **Refrigeration & AC**: Transition from HFCs to low-GWP alternatives (HFOs, natural refrigerants)
- **Compliance**: Reporting under Kigali Amendment
- **Illegal Trade**: Black market CFCs still seized (non-compliance in developing countries)

## Key Standards & Frameworks

### International Treaty
- **[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987)](https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol)** — Legally binding treaty
- **[Kigali Amendment (2016)](https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol/amendments/kigali-amendment)** — HFC phase-down

### Disclosure Standards
- **[GRI 305](/standards/gri/)** — Emissions (includes ODS in Scope 1)
- **[EU F-Gas Regulation](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/fluorinated-greenhouse-gases_en)** — HFC phase-down in EU

## Recommended Metrics

### Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS)
- **ODS Emissions**: Tonnes of ODP (ozone depletion potential) weighted substances
- **Common ODS**: CFCs, HCFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide
- **Reporting**: GRI 305-6 (Emissions of ozone-depleting substances)

### HFC Emissions (Climate Impact)
- **HFC Emissions**: Tonnes of CO₂e (high GWP: 1,300-14,800× CO₂)
- **Refrigerant Leakage Rate**: % of charge lost annually
- **HFC Phase-down Progress**: % transition to low-GWP alternatives

### Alternative Refrigerants
- **Natural Refrigerants**: Ammonia (NH₃), CO₂ (R-744), hydrocarbons (propane, isobutane)
- **HFOs (Hydrofluoroolefins)**: Low-GWP synthetic alternatives (GWP <10)

## Montreal Protocol Success Story

**Key Achievements**:
- **99% ODS phase-out** (2020)
- **Antarctic ozone hole**: Shrinking since 2000
- **Climate co-benefit**: Avoided 1-2°C additional warming by 2100
- **Universal ratification**: 197 parties (every UN member state)

**Recovery Timeline**:
- **Mid-latitudes**: Ozone returned to 1980 levels by ~2040
- **Arctic**: By ~2045
- **Antarctic**: By ~2066
