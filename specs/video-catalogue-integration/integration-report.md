## Post-deploy corrections & verification (2026-07-20)

- **Fix:** the 2 JPX single-video entries were first written as `{% include video-embed.html %}` blocks, but `/learning/videos/` renders via the generic [...slug] markdown pipeline which shows includes as raw text (only the custom `/videos` page parses them). Converted both to the page's prose format in DB + script updated for future runs. Verified: 0 raw includes on the live page.
- **Idempotency:** second dry-run after apply = 0 lines added, 0 dead-handle occurrences (AC-8). Required a YouTube-ID dedupe check (embed→prose IDs, case-insensitive).
- **Live render:** new entries confirmed on `/en/learning/courses` and `/en/learning/videos` (AC-9).
- **Lychee sweep of both pages:** 195 links, 0 failures from integrated records. 3 pre-existing issues: `github.com/simonplmak-cloud/esg-hub` (404 for anonymous — repo is private; linked from `Footer.tsx:52` on every page — needs repo-visibility decision), `unccelearn.org/course/view.php?id=139` (connection reset — pre-existing UNCC link).
