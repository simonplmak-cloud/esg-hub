# Indigenous Peoples' Rights

**Indigenous peoples** have distinct rights recognized in international law, including rights to lands, resources, and self-determination.

## UN Declaration on Indigenous Rights

The **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)** establishes minimum standards including:

**Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)** — Right to give or withhold consent to projects affecting their lands  
**Land Rights** — Rights to lands, territories, and resources  
**Cultural Rights** — Rights to maintain and strengthen cultures  
**Self-Determination** — Rights to determine own development priorities

## Free, Prior and Informed Consent

**FPIC** requires:

**Free** — No coercion, intimidation, or manipulation  
**Prior** — Sufficient time before project authorization  
**Informed** — Full information about project and impacts  
**Consent** — Right to say yes or no

## Business Impacts

Projects affecting indigenous lands can face:
- Legal challenges and project delays  
- Reputational damage  
- Loss of social license to operate  
- Financial impacts from project disruption

## Best Practices

**Early Engagement** — Consult before project design  
**Cultural Competence** — Understand indigenous governance and decision-making  
**Benefit Sharing** — Ensure equitable distribution of project benefits  
**Impact Assessment** — Assess cultural, social, and environmental impacts
