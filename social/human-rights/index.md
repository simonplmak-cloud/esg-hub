# S2: Human Rights

**Fundamental rights inherent to all human beings, based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights treaties**

## Framework Context

Human Rights is the second core subject in ISO 26000, recognizing that **organizations have a responsibility to respect human rights** wherever they operate. This responsibility exists independently of states' abilities or willingness to fulfill their own human rights obligations.

The corporate responsibility to respect human rights is authoritatively defined in the **UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)**, endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011. The UNGPs establish that companies must:

1. **Avoid causing or contributing** to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities
2. **Seek to prevent or mitigate** adverse human rights impacts directly linked to their operations, products, or services by business relationships
3. **Provide for or cooperate in remediation** when they have caused or contributed to adverse impacts

## International Human Rights Framework

Human rights are grounded in international law, primarily:

**Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR, 1948)**  
Foundation document proclaiming fundamental human rights to be universally protected.

**International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, 1966)**  
Treaty covering civil and political rights including freedom of expression, assembly, fair trial, and freedom from torture.

**International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR, 1966)**  
Treaty covering economic, social, and cultural rights including right to work, education, health, and adequate standard of living.

**ILO Core Conventions (1930-1999)**  
Eight fundamental conventions establishing core labor rights (freedom of association, no forced labor, no child labor, no discrimination).
