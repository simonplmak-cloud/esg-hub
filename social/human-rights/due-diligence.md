# Human Rights Due Diligence

**Human rights due diligence (HRDD)** is the process companies use to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for how they address actual and potential adverse human rights impacts.

## UN Guiding Principles Framework

The **UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)** establish the corporate responsibility to respect human rights through due diligence:

1. **Policy Commitment** — Public statement of respect for human rights  
2. **Impact Assessment** — Identify actual and potential impacts  
3. **Integration** — Embed findings into business processes  
4. **Tracking** — Monitor effectiveness of responses  
5. **Communication** — Report publicly on how impacts are addressed  
6. **Remediation** — Provide for or cooperate in remediation

## Risk-Based Approach

HRDD should be **proportionate to severity and likelihood** of impacts:

**Severity** — Scale, scope, and irremediability of impact  
**Likelihood** — Probability of occurrence  
**Priority** — Focus on most severe risks first

## Salient Human Rights Issues

Companies should identify **salient issues** — those most at risk of severe negative impact through company activities or business relationships.

## Regulatory Requirements

**EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)** — Mandatory HRDD for large companies  
**German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act** — HRDD across supply chains  
**French Duty of Vigilance Law** — Vigilance plans for large companies
