# Social Hub

**Comprehensive framework for social responsibility based on ISO 26000**

## Framework Context

The Social dimension of ESG is organized according to **ISO 26000:2010 Guidance on Social Responsibility**, the internationally recognized standard that provides comprehensive guidance on socially responsible behavior for organizations of all types and sizes.

ISO 26000 identifies **seven core subjects** of social responsibility, six of which form the structure of this Social Hub (Organizational Governance is treated as a cross-cutting governance topic):

1. **Organizational Governance** — Ethical leadership and stakeholder-inclusive decision-making
2. **Human Rights** — Respecting and supporting internationally recognized human rights
3. **Labour Practices** — Fair employment, safe working conditions, and worker development
4. **Fair Operating Practices** — Anti-corruption, responsible political involvement, fair competition
5. **Consumer Issues** — Product safety, data privacy, fair marketing, access to essential services
6. **Community Involvement & Development** — Contributing to community well-being and development

## Why ISO 26000?

ISO 26000 provides the most comprehensive and internationally accepted framework for understanding corporate social responsibility. Unlike other ISO standards, ISO 26000 is a **guidance standard** (not certifiable), making it flexible and applicable across all sectors and organization types.

**Key Principles**:
- Accountability
- Transparency
- Ethical behavior
- Respect for stakeholder interests
- Respect for the rule of law
- Respect for international norms of behavior
- Respect for human rights

## Integration with ESG Reporting Standards

ISO 26000 core subjects map directly to social disclosure requirements in major ESG frameworks:
