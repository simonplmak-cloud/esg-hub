# Stakeholder-Inclusive Decision-Making

**Processes that identify, engage, and consider the interests of stakeholders affected by organizational decisions**

## Framework Context

Stakeholder-inclusive decision-making is a core principle of ISO 26000 organizational governance. It recognizes that organizations operate within a complex web of relationships with multiple stakeholders whose interests may be affected by organizational decisions and activities.

Unlike traditional shareholder-centric governance, stakeholder-inclusive governance acknowledges that **long-term organizational success depends on creating value for all stakeholders** — employees, customers, suppliers, communities, environment, and shareholders — not just maximizing short-term shareholder returns.

## Stakeholder Theory Foundation

**Stakeholder Theory** (Freeman, 1984) posits that companies must manage relationships with all groups who can affect or are affected by corporate activities. This theory provides the conceptual foundation for stakeholder-inclusive governance.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Stakeholder Identification** — Identify all groups affected by organizational activities
2. **Stakeholder Engagement** — Engage with stakeholders to understand their interests and concerns
3. **Stakeholder Balancing** — Balance competing stakeholder interests in decision-making
4. **Stakeholder Accountability** — Be accountable to all stakeholders, not just shareholders

## Stakeholder Identification and Mapping

Organizations should systematically identify stakeholders and assess their interests, influence, and legitimacy.

### Stakeholder Categories

| Stakeholder Group | Interests | Engagement Approach |
|:------------------|:----------|:--------------------|
| **Employees** | Fair wages, safe working conditions, career development | Involve & Collaborate |
| **Customers** | Product safety, quality, fair pricing, data privacy | Involve & Consult |
| **Suppliers** | Fair contracts, timely payment, long-term relationships | Consult & Inform |
| **Communities** | Local employment, environmental protection, social investment | Consult & Inform |
| **Investors** | Financial returns, ESG performance, long-term value | Involve & Report |
| **Regulators** | Compliance, transparency, cooperation | Comply & Collaborate |
| **NGOs/Civil Society** | Human rights, environmental protection, accountability | Consult & Monitor |

### Stakeholder Mapping Matrix

**Power-Interest Grid** (Mendelow, 1981):

- **High Power, High Interest** → Manage closely (key players)
- **High Power, Low Interest** → Keep satisfied (context setters)
- **Low Power, High Interest** → Keep informed (subjects)
- **Low Power, Low Interest** → Monitor (crowd)

## Multi-Stakeholder Engagement Mechanisms

Organizations should establish formal processes for stakeholder engagement:

### Ongoing Engagement
- **Employee representation** on boards or advisory councils
- **Customer advisory panels** for product development
- **Supplier forums** for supply chain collaboration
- **Community liaison committees** for local engagement
- **Investor roadshows** and ESG engagement meetings

### Periodic Consultation
- **Stakeholder surveys** to assess satisfaction and concerns
- **Public consultations** on major projects or policy changes
- **Multi-stakeholder dialogues** on material ESG issues
- **Annual stakeholder forums** to review performance and priorities

### Grievance Mechanisms
- **Whistleblower hotlines** for employees and suppliers
- **Customer complaint systems** with transparent resolution processes
- **Community grievance mechanisms** for local concerns
- **Human rights complaint mechanisms** aligned with UN Guiding Principles

## Stakeholder Consultation in Material Decisions

Organizations should consult stakeholders when making decisions that significantly affect their interests:

**Examples of Material Decisions**:
- **Strategic decisions** — Mergers, acquisitions, major investments, business model changes
- **Operational decisions** — Plant closures, layoffs, relocation, technology changes
- **Product decisions** — New product launches, product recalls, pricing changes
- **Environmental decisions** — Major projects with environmental impacts, climate transition plans
- **Social decisions** — Changes to labor practices, community investment, human rights policies

## Balancing Competing Stakeholder Interests

Stakeholder interests often conflict, requiring organizations to make difficult trade-offs:

**Balancing Framework**:
1. **Identify conflicts** — Which stakeholder interests are in tension?
2. **Assess impacts** — What are the consequences for each stakeholder group?
3. **Consider principles** — Which decision aligns with organizational values and international norms?
4. **Seek win-win solutions** — Can we find solutions that create value for multiple stakeholders?
5. **Communicate transparently** — Explain the rationale for difficult decisions

## Best Practices

**1. Formalize Stakeholder Engagement**  
Establish a board-level committee or senior management role responsible for stakeholder engagement strategy and oversight.

**2. Materiality Assessment with Stakeholders**  
Conduct double materiality assessments (financial + impact materiality) with stakeholder input to identify priority ESG topics.

**3. Transparent Reporting**  
Disclose stakeholder engagement processes, key concerns raised, and how stakeholder input influenced decisions.

**4. Remedy and Grievance Mechanisms**  
Implement accessible, transparent grievance mechanisms aligned with UN Guiding Principles Effectiveness Criteria (legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, based on engagement and dialogue, continuous learning).

**5. Long-Term Stakeholder Value Creation**  
Integrate stakeholder value creation into strategy, performance metrics, and executive compensation.
