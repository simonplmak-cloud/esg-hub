# S1: Organizational Governance

**The system by which organizations make and implement decisions to achieve their objectives while respecting stakeholder interests**

## Framework Context

Organizational Governance is the first core subject in ISO 26000, serving as the **foundational enabler** for all other aspects of social responsibility. It encompasses the decision-making structures, processes, and leadership behaviors that determine how an organization addresses its social, environmental, and economic impacts.

Unlike corporate governance (which focuses on shareholder interests and board structures), organizational governance in the ISO 26000 context emphasizes **multi-stakeholder accountability** and ethical decision-making that considers impacts on all affected parties.

## Key Principles

**Accountability**  
Organizations should be accountable for their impacts on society, the economy, and the environment, including accepting responsibility for negative impacts and taking action to remedy them.

**Transparency**  
Organizations should be transparent in decisions and activities that affect society and the environment, disclosing relevant information to stakeholders in accessible and timely ways.

**Ethical Behavior**  
Organizations should behave ethically, based on values of honesty, equity, and integrity, respecting people, animals, and the environment.

**Respect for Stakeholder Interests**  
Organizations should respect, consider, and respond to the interests of their stakeholders, recognizing that stakeholders have rights, claims, or specific interests that should be taken into account.

## Core Topics

## Integration with ESG Frameworks

Organizational governance principles underpin disclosure requirements across major ESG standards:

| Framework | Governance Requirements |
|:----------|:------------------------|
| **IFRS S1** | Governance processes for identifying, assessing, and managing sustainability-related risks and opportunities (IFRS S1 para 26-27) |
| **GRI 2** | Governance structure, policies, and practices (GRI 2-9 to 2-28) |
| **ESRS 2** | Governance, strategy, and business conduct (GOV-1 to GOV-5) |
| **ISO 26000** | Organizational governance as foundational core subject |

## Relationship to Corporate Governance

While **corporate governance** (covered in the [Governance Hub](/governance/)) focuses on board structures, shareholder rights, and fiduciary duties, **organizational governance** in the social context emphasizes:

| Corporate Governance | Organizational Governance (Social) |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Shareholder primacy or stakeholder consideration | Multi-stakeholder accountability |
| Board composition and independence | Ethical leadership and tone from top |
| Fiduciary duties to shareholders | Responsibility to all affected stakeholders |
| Compliance with laws and regulations | Respect for international norms and human rights |
| Financial performance oversight | Social, environmental, and economic impact oversight |

Both are complementary and essential for responsible business conduct.
