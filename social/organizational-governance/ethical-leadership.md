# Ethical Leadership

**Leadership that demonstrates integrity, accountability, and transparency in decision-making and organizational culture**

## Framework Context

Ethical leadership is a fundamental component of organizational governance under ISO 26000. It refers to the **tone from the top** — the values, behaviors, and decision-making processes demonstrated by boards and senior management that shape organizational culture and guide employee behavior.

Ethical leadership goes beyond compliance with laws and regulations to embrace a commitment to doing what is right, even when it is difficult or costly. It is essential for building trust with stakeholders, maintaining social license to operate, and creating long-term sustainable value.

## Key Elements

### Tone from the Top

The board and senior management set the ethical tone through their words, actions, and decisions. This includes:

- **Visible commitment** to ethical values and social responsibility
- **Consistent behavior** that aligns with stated values
- **Accountability** for ethical failures and willingness to take corrective action
- **Resource allocation** that prioritizes ethical conduct and stakeholder interests

### Code of Conduct and Ethics Policies

Organizations should establish clear written standards for ethical behavior:

- **Code of Conduct** — Core values, expected behaviors, and prohibited conduct
- **Anti-Corruption Policy** — Zero tolerance for bribery, facilitation payments, and conflicts of interest
- **Human Rights Policy** — Commitment to respect internationally recognized human rights
- **Supplier Code of Conduct** — Ethical expectations for business partners
- **Conflict of Interest Policy** — Disclosure and management of personal interests that may conflict with organizational duties

### Whistleblower Protection

Mechanisms that enable employees and stakeholders to report unethical conduct without fear of retaliation:

- **Anonymous reporting channels** (hotlines, online portals)
- **Non-retaliation policies** and enforcement
- **Independent investigation processes**
- **Transparent reporting** of whistleblower cases (aggregated, anonymized)

### Ethics Training and Awareness

Regular training programs that embed ethical decision-making in organizational culture:

- **Onboarding ethics training** for all new employees
- **Annual refresher training** on code of conduct
- **Scenario-based training** on ethical dilemmas
- **Leadership ethics programs** for managers and executives
- **Third-party training** for suppliers and business partners

### Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks

Structured approaches to navigate ethical dilemmas:

- **Stakeholder impact assessment** — Who is affected and how?
- **Values alignment** — Does this decision align with our stated values?
- **Legal compliance** — Does this meet legal and regulatory requirements?
- **Public disclosure test** — Would we be comfortable if this decision were made public?
- **Long-term consequences** — What are the long-term impacts on stakeholders and reputation?

## Best Practices

**1. Board Oversight of Ethics**  
Establish a board-level ethics or governance committee responsible for overseeing ethical conduct, reviewing ethics policies, and monitoring compliance.

**2. Regular Ethics Risk Assessments**  
Conduct periodic assessments to identify emerging ethical risks (e.g., corruption, conflicts of interest, human rights violations) and update policies accordingly.

**3. Ethics Performance Metrics**  
Track and report metrics such as:
- Ethics training completion rates
- Whistleblower reports received and resolved
- Ethics violations and disciplinary actions
- Ethics audit findings

**4. ESG-Linked Executive Compensation**  
Integrate ethical conduct and ESG performance into executive compensation to align incentives with long-term stakeholder value.

**5. Third-Party Ethics Due Diligence**  
Conduct ethics due diligence on suppliers, joint venture partners, and other business partners to prevent complicity in unethical conduct.
