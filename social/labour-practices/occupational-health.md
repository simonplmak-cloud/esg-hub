# Occupational Health & Safety

**Occupational health and safety (OHS)** protects workers from work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities.

## Global Burden

**2.9 million deaths** annually from work-related causes  
**374 million** non-fatal work injuries per year  
**Economic cost:** 4% of global GDP

## OHS Management Systems

**ISO 45001** — International standard for OHS management systems  
**ILO-OSH 2001** — ILO Guidelines on OHS management systems

### Key Elements

**Hazard Identification** — Systematic identification of workplace hazards  
**Risk Assessment** — Evaluate likelihood and severity of harm  
**Control Measures** — Hierarchy of controls (elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative, PPE)  
**Training** — Worker competence and awareness  
**Emergency Preparedness** — Plans for incidents and emergencies  
**Monitoring** — Track leading and lagging indicators

## High-Risk Sectors

**Construction** — Falls, struck-by hazards, electrocution  
**Manufacturing** — Machinery hazards, chemical exposure  
**Mining** — Respiratory hazards, collapse risks  
**Agriculture** — Pesticide exposure, machinery accidents  
**Healthcare** — Biological hazards, violence

## Leading vs Lagging Indicators

**Lagging Indicators** — Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR), fatalities  
**Leading Indicators** — Near-miss reporting, safety training hours, hazard identification rate

## Regulatory Requirements

**ILO Conventions** — C155 (Occupational Safety and Health), C187 (Promotional Framework)  
**National Regulations** — OSHA (US), HSE (UK), WorkSafe (Australia)
