# Living Wage

A **living wage** is the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet basic needs including food, housing, healthcare, education, and savings for unexpected events.

## Living Wage vs Minimum Wage

**Minimum Wage** — Legal minimum set by government (often insufficient)  
**Living Wage** — Calculated based on actual cost of living (higher than minimum wage in most countries)

## Living Wage Calculation

Living wage benchmarks consider:
- **Food** — Nutritious diet for family  
- **Housing** — Adequate shelter  
- **Healthcare** — Medical expenses  
- **Education** — School fees and supplies  
- **Transport** — Commuting costs  
- **Savings** — Emergency fund (typically 5-10% of income)

## Business Case

**Regulatory Compliance** — Anticipates future living wage regulations

## Implementation Challenges

**Supply Chain Complexity** — Difficult to ensure living wages across tiers  
**Cost Pressures** — Buyers must accept higher prices  
**Informal Economy** — Hard to monitor in informal work arrangements
