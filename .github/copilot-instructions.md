# Copilot Instructions

These instructions apply to all Copilot coding agent and Copilot code review activity in this repository.

## Stack rules

- pnpm only (respect `packageManager` pin; commit lockfile changes) — never npm/yarn
- TypeScript strict; no `any`; ESM; Zod for runtime validation
- Conventional commits; PR-only changes; never commit secrets or `.env`
- Do not weaken CI steps, tests, or coverage to force green — document pre-existing failures instead

## MCP tools — use ALL available, for their strengths

| Tool | Use it for |
|------|-----------|
| context7 (`resolve-library-id`, `get-library-docs`) | Any library/framework API question — check docs before writing API code; never guess signatures |
| perplexity (`perplexity_search/ask/reason/research`) | Current best practices, comparisons, error diagnosis, multi-source research |
| brave-search (`brave_web_search`, `brave_news_search`) | Real-time facts, release notes, changelogs, breaking changes |
| Playwright (default) | Verify UI changes render correctly; check console errors; screenshot before finishing frontend work |
| GitHub (default) | Issues, PRs, code search, prior art in this and related repos |

If an MCP tool fails, report the error and continue with the remaining tools — never skip verification silently.

## Custom agents in this repo

- **software-developer** — all code changes (features, fixes, refactors)
- **researcher** — R&D, technology evaluations, decision records (documents only, no code)
- **writer-publisher** — content, docs, i18n, translations in multiple languages/styles/tones/formats

Choose the agent matching the task type; combine researcher → software-developer for research-driven implementation.

## Repo specifics

- Next.js 15 + SurrealDB Cloud; i18n locales: en, zh, hi — keep all three in sync for content changes
- Depends on sibling private repo `tool_packages` (see CI checkout pattern in test.yml/ci.yml)
- pnpm@10.30.3; Node 20 in CI, Node 22 in devcontainer (.nvmrc)
- Playwright E2E stays on-demand (test.yml), not in PR CI
