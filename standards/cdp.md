# CDP

**CDP** (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) operates the world's leading environmental disclosure platform, enabling companies, cities, states, and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts. Over **23,000 organizations** disclosed through CDP in 2024, representing over **two-thirds of global market capitalization**.

## Framework Overview

CDP administers three main disclosure questionnaires covering climate, water security, and forests. Each questionnaire uses a structured scoring methodology to assess environmental performance and transparency.

### Three Disclosure Areas

**Climate Change** — GHG emissions, climate risks, and decarbonization strategies
- Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reporting
- Climate-related risks and opportunities (TCFD-aligned)
- Emissions reduction targets and progress
- Climate governance and strategy

**Water Security** — Water management and water-related risks
- Water withdrawal, discharge, and consumption
- Water stress assessment by facility
- Water-related risks and opportunities
- Water stewardship initiatives

**Forests** — Deforestation-free supply chains
- Commodity exposure (timber, palm oil, cattle products, soy, rubber)
- Deforestation risks in supply chain
- Sustainable sourcing commitments
- Traceability and certification

### Scoring Methodology

CDP uses an **8-level scoring system** from D- to A:

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **A** | Leadership | Implementing current best practices |
| **A-** | Leadership | Strong performance with minor gaps |
| **B** | Management | Taking coordinated action on environmental issues |
| **B-** | Management | Coordinated action with some gaps |
| **C** | Awareness | Knowledge of environmental impacts |
| **C-** | Awareness | Awareness with limited action |
| **D** | Disclosure | Disclosing environmental data |
| **D-** | Disclosure | Minimal disclosure |
| **F** | Failure | Failed to provide sufficient information |

Scoring assesses four progressive levels:
1. **Disclosure** — Measuring environmental impact
2. **Awareness** — Understanding environmental issues
3. **Management** — Implementing actions to address impacts
4. **Leadership** — Best practices and industry leadership

## Why CDP Matters

### Investor Demand

CDP disclosure is requested by **740+ institutional investors** with over **$136 trillion in assets**. Many investors use CDP scores as a key ESG performance indicator when making investment decisions.

### Supply Chain Pressure

Over **280 major purchasing organizations** with **$6.4 trillion in procurement spend** request their suppliers to disclose through CDP's supply chain program. This creates cascading disclosure requirements throughout value chains.

### Regulatory Alignment

CDP questionnaires are aligned with major reporting frameworks:
- **TCFD** — Climate questionnaire incorporates all 11 TCFD recommendations
- **IFRS S2** — CDP climate data can support IFRS S2 disclosures
- **ESRS E1** — CDP climate data supports ESRS E1 compliance
- **GRI** — CDP indicators map to GRI 305 (Emissions) and other standards

### Public Disclosure

CDP responses are made **publicly available** (unless marked confidential), creating transparency and enabling stakeholder scrutiny of environmental performance.
