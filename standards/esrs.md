# ESRS

The **European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)** are mandatory reporting standards for sustainability disclosures under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and adopted by the European Commission in July 2023, ESRS represents the most comprehensive sustainability reporting framework globally, covering environmental, social, and governance topics through a **double materiality lens**.

## Framework Overview

ESRS consists of **12 standards** organized into three categories: cross-cutting standards, environmental standards, and social/governance standards.

### Cross-Cutting Standards

**ESRS 1: General Requirements** — Defines fundamental concepts, principles, and structure for sustainability reporting
- Double materiality assessment methodology
- Value chain reporting requirements
- Time horizons and scenario analysis
- Reporting boundaries and consolidation

**ESRS 2: General Disclosures** — Mandatory disclosures required for all companies
- Governance, strategy, and business model (GOV-1 to GOV-5)
- Stakeholder engagement (SBM-2)
- Material impacts, risks, and opportunities (SBM-3)
- Policies, actions, metrics, and targets (MDR framework)

### Environmental Standards (E1-E5)

**ESRS E1: Climate Change** — Climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities (based on TCFD/IFRS S2)
- GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3)
- Transition plans and decarbonization targets
- Physical and transition risks
- Climate scenario analysis

**ESRS E2: Pollution** — Air, water, and soil pollution
- Emissions to air, water, and soil
- Substances of concern and very high concern
- Microplastics

**ESRS E3: Water and Marine Resources** — Water consumption, withdrawal, and marine impacts
- Water consumption and withdrawal by source
- Water stress areas
- Marine resource exploitation

**ESRS E4: Biodiversity and Ecosystems** — Nature-related impacts and dependencies (aligned with TNFD)
- Impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems
- Dependencies on ecosystem services
- Transition plans for nature-positive outcomes

**ESRS E5: Resource Use and Circular Economy** — Resource efficiency and circularity
- Resource inflows (materials, products)
- Resource outflows (products, waste)
- Circular economy strategies

### Social Standards (S1-S4)

**ESRS S1: Own Workforce** — Company's own employees and workers
- Working conditions, equal treatment, health & safety
- Social dialogue and collective bargaining
- Training and skills development
- Diversity metrics (gender, age, disability)

**ESRS S2: Workers in the Value Chain** — Upstream and downstream workers
- Working conditions in supply chain
- Human rights due diligence
- Forced labor and child labor risks

**ESRS S3: Affected Communities** — Communities impacted by operations
- Economic, social, and cultural rights of communities
- Indigenous peoples' rights
- Land rights and displacement

**ESRS S4: Consumers and End-Users** — Product/service users
- Consumer health and safety
- Data privacy and protection
- Fair marketing and consumer information

### Governance Standards (G1)

**ESRS G1: Business Conduct** — Corporate governance and ethics
- Corporate culture and business ethics
- Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
- Political influence and lobbying
- Payment practices and supplier relationships

## Double Materiality

ESRS requires companies to assess **double materiality** — considering both impact materiality and financial materiality:

**Impact Materiality (Inside-Out):** How the company's activities affect people and the environment
- Positive and negative impacts
- Actual and potential impacts
- Short, medium, and long-term impacts

**Financial Materiality (Outside-In):** How sustainability matters create financial risks and opportunities for the company
- Risks to business model and financial position
- Opportunities from sustainability trends
- Dependencies on natural and social capital

A topic is material if it meets **either** impact materiality **or** financial materiality criteria (or both). This differs from IFRS S1/S2, which uses only financial materiality.

## Why ESRS Matters

### Mandatory Scope

CSRD applies to approximately **50,000 companies** in the EU, making ESRS the most widely mandated sustainability reporting framework:

| Company Type | Employees | Revenue/Assets | Effective Date |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Large EU companies** (already under NFRD) | >500 | N/A | FY2024 (report 2025) |
| **Other large EU companies** | >250 OR | €50M revenue OR €25M assets | FY2025 (report 2026) |
| **Listed SMEs** | N/A | Listed on EU regulated markets | FY2026 (report 2027) |
| **Non-EU companies** | N/A | €150M EU revenue + EU subsidiary/branch | FY2028 (report 2029) |

### Assurance Requirement

CSRD mandates **limited assurance** of sustainability information from the first reporting year, progressing to **reasonable assurance** in the future. This makes ESRS disclosures subject to the same audit rigor as financial statements.
