The **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** provides a framework for organizations to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities to investors, lenders, and other stakeholders. Established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2015, the TCFD framework has become the global baseline for climate-related financial reporting, with its recommendations now embedded in IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures and regulatory requirements worldwide.

## Framework Overview

### Four Pillars Structure

The TCFD framework consists of **11 recommended disclosures** organized around four thematic pillars that represent core elements of how organizations operate:

**1. Governance** — Disclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities
- Board oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities
- Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities

**2. Strategy** — Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning
- Climate-related risks and opportunities identified over short, medium, and long term
- Impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on businesses, strategy, and financial planning
- Resilience of strategy under different climate scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario

**3. Risk Management** — Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks
- Processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks
- Processes for managing climate-related risks
- Integration of climate-related risk processes into overall risk management

**4. Metrics and Targets** — Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities
- Metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with strategy and risk management
- Scope 1, Scope 2, and (if appropriate) Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
- Targets used to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets

### Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities

The TCFD framework categorizes climate-related issues into two main types:

**Physical Risks** — Risks from physical impacts of climate change
- **Acute:** Event-driven (hurricanes, floods, wildfires, heat waves)
- **Chronic:** Longer-term shifts (temperature changes, sea-level rise, chronic heat waves, water stress)

**Transition Risks** — Risks from transitioning to a lower-carbon economy
- **Policy and legal:** Carbon pricing, emissions limits, litigation
- **Technology:** Substitution of existing products/services, unsuccessful investment in new technologies
- **Market:** Changing customer behavior, uncertainty in market signals, increased cost of raw materials
- **Reputation:** Stigmatization of sector, increased stakeholder concern, negative stakeholder feedback

**Opportunities** — Potential positive impacts from climate action
- **Resource efficiency:** Reduced operating costs through efficiency gains
- **Energy source:** Use of lower-emission sources, participation in carbon markets
- **Products and services:** Development of new products/services, diversification of business activities
- **Markets:** Access to new markets, access to public-sector incentives
- **Resilience:** Improved resilience to climate impacts, participation in renewable energy programs

## Why TCFD Matters

### Regulatory Integration

TCFD recommendations have been incorporated into mandatory disclosure requirements in multiple jurisdictions:

| Jurisdiction | Regulation | Status |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| **United Kingdom** | Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) Regulations 2022 | Mandatory for premium-listed companies and large private companies (FY2022+) |
| **European Union** | Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) with ESRS E1 | Mandatory for ~50,000 companies (phased 2024-2028) |
| **New Zealand** | Climate-related Disclosures Requirements | Mandatory for large financial institutions and listed companies (FY2023+) |
| **Singapore** | SGX Listing Rules | Mandatory climate reporting on comply-or-explain basis (FY2022+) |
| **Hong Kong** | HKEX ESG Reporting Guide | Mandatory TCFD-aligned climate disclosures (FY2025+) |
| **Japan** | Cabinet Office Ordinance on Disclosure of Corporate Information | TCFD-based disclosure for Prime Market companies (FY2023+) |
| **Switzerland** | CO2 Act and Ordinance on Climate Disclosures | Mandatory for large companies (FY2024+) |
| **California, USA** | SB 253 (Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act) | Mandatory Scope 1-3 emissions disclosure (2026+) |

### ISSB Integration

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) built **IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures** directly on the TCFD framework, making TCFD recommendations the foundation for global baseline climate reporting. Organizations reporting under IFRS S2 automatically satisfy TCFD recommendations, as S2 incorporates and expands upon all 11 TCFD disclosures.

Key enhancements in IFRS S2:
- More prescriptive guidance on scenario analysis
- Explicit requirement for Scope 3 emissions disclosure
- Industry-specific metrics from SASB Standards
- Financed emissions disclosure for financial institutions
- Transition plan disclosure requirements

## Implementation Guidance

### Step 1: Establish Governance

**Board Oversight:**
- Designate board committee responsible for climate oversight (e.g., Audit Committee, Risk Committee, Sustainability Committee)
- Define frequency of climate briefings to the board (quarterly, semi-annually, annually)
- Document board's role in reviewing and approving climate strategy, targets, and major capital expenditures
- Disclose board members' climate competency and training

**Management Responsibility:**
- Assign management-level responsibility for climate (e.g., Chief Sustainability Officer, Chief Risk Officer)
- Establish cross-functional climate working group or steering committee
- Define reporting lines from management to board
- Document management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities

### Step 2: Assess Strategy Impacts

**Identify Risks and Opportunities:**
- Conduct climate risk assessment across value chain (upstream, operations, downstream)
- Use TCFD categories (physical acute/chronic, transition policy/technology/market/reputation, opportunities)
- Define time horizons relevant to business (e.g., short: 0-3 years, medium: 3-10 years, long: 10-30 years)
- Assess financial impacts (revenue, expenditures, assets/liabilities, capital/financing)

**Scenario Analysis:**
- Select climate scenarios aligned with IPCC pathways (e.g., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) or IEA scenarios (e.g., Net Zero Emissions by 2050, Stated Policies)
- TCFD recommends including a 2°C or lower scenario
- Assess business resilience under each scenario
- Identify strategic responses and adaptation measures
- Quantify financial implications where possible

**Transition Planning:**
- Develop transition plan aligned with Paris Agreement goals (1.5°C pathway)
- Set interim milestones and long-term targets
- Identify required capital expenditures and operational changes
- Assess impact on business model and value chain
- Disclose assumptions, dependencies, and uncertainties

### Step 3: Integrate Risk Management

**Identification Process:**
- Integrate climate risk identification into enterprise risk management (ERM) framework
- Use tools such as physical risk mapping (e.g., WRI Aqueduct, Climate Engine), transition risk modeling (e.g., NGFS scenarios)
- Assess risks across value chain and geographies
- Consider both asset-level and portfolio-level risks

**Assessment Process:**
- Evaluate likelihood and magnitude of climate risks
- Use consistent risk rating methodology with other enterprise risks
- Assess time horizon and velocity of risks
- Consider cascading and compounding effects

**Management Process:**
- Assign risk ownership and accountability
- Develop mitigation and adaptation strategies
- Monitor risk indicators and trigger points
- Report climate risks to board and senior management
- Integrate climate risks into capital allocation and strategic planning

### Step 4: Report Metrics and Targets

**Core Metrics (Required for All Organizations):**

**GHG Emissions:**
- **Scope 1:** Direct emissions from owned/controlled sources
- **Scope 2:** Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating, cooling
- **Scope 3:** All other indirect emissions in value chain (15 categories per GHG Protocol)
- Report in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e)
- Disclose methodology, emission factors, and organizational boundary

**Climate-Related Targets:**
- Absolute emissions reduction targets (e.g., 50% reduction by 2030 vs. 2020 baseline)
- Intensity-based targets (e.g., tCO2e per unit of revenue, per product)
- Renewable energy targets (e.g., 100% renewable electricity by 2030)
- Alignment with science-based targets (SBTi validation)
- Interim milestones and progress reporting

**Industry-Specific Metrics:**

The TCFD provides supplemental guidance for four sectors with significant climate exposure:
- **Energy:** Reserves, production, energy mix
- **Transportation:** Fleet composition, fuel efficiency, alternative fuel adoption
- **Materials and Buildings:** Energy/water intensity, green building certifications
- **Agriculture, Food, and Forest Products:** Land use, water management, sustainable sourcing

Organizations should also refer to **SASB Standards** for industry-specific climate metrics aligned with TCFD.

## Regional Implementation

### Hong Kong

The **Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX)** mandates TCFD-aligned climate disclosures for all listed issuers starting from financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The requirements cover all four TCFD pillars, with phased implementation for Scope 3 emissions (mandatory from FY2026 for large-cap issuers).

### Singapore

The **Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)** requires financial institutions to make climate-related disclosures aligned with TCFD recommendations. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) mandates climate reporting on a "comply or explain" basis for all listed issuers, with full compliance expected by FY2022.

### European Union

The EU's **European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)** incorporate TCFD recommendations within **ESRS E1: Climate Change**. Organizations reporting under CSRD automatically satisfy TCFD requirements through ESRS E1 disclosures.
