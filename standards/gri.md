The **GRI Standards** (Global Reporting Initiative Standards) represent the world's most widely used framework for sustainability reporting, enabling organizations to publicly disclose their most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people. Updated in 2021, the GRI Standards use a modular structure comprising Universal, Sector, and Topic Standards that guide organizations in reporting material sustainability information to stakeholders.

## Framework Overview

### Modular Structure

The GRI Standards operate as an interconnected system of three standard types:

**1. Universal Standards** — Apply to all organizations using GRI Standards
- **GRI 1: Foundation 2021** — Core concepts and requirements for GRI reporting
- **GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021** — Organizational context and reporting practices
- **GRI 3: Material Topics 2021** — Process for determining and reporting material topics

**2. Sector Standards** — Provide sector-specific likely material topics
- **GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector 2021** — First sector standard released
- **GRI 12: Coal Sector 2022**
- **GRI 13: Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fishing Sectors 2022**
- **GRI 14: Mining Sector 2024**
- Additional sectors in development (40 sectors planned)

**3. Topic Standards** — Disclosures for specific sustainability topics
- **Economic** (GRI 201-207): Economic performance, market presence, indirect impacts, procurement, anti-corruption, anti-competitive behavior, tax
- **Environmental** (GRI 301-308): Materials, energy, water, biodiversity, emissions, waste, environmental compliance, supplier environmental assessment
- **Social** (GRI 401-418): Employment, labor relations, occupational health and safety, training, diversity, non-discrimination, freedom of association, child labor, forced labor, security practices, indigenous rights, human rights assessment, local communities, supplier social assessment, public policy, customer health and safety, marketing and labeling, customer privacy, socioeconomic compliance

### Impact Materiality Approach

GRI Standards use an **impact materiality** lens, requiring organizations to report on their most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, regardless of whether those impacts affect enterprise value. This contrasts with the financial materiality approach of IFRS S1/S2, which focuses on sustainability matters that could affect the organization's financial position.

**Double materiality:** Organizations subject to both GRI and IFRS S1/S2 (or ESRS) must assess:
- **Impact materiality** (GRI) — Effects on economy, environment, people
- **Financial materiality** (IFRS/ESRS) — Effects on enterprise value

The European Union's ESRS explicitly requires double materiality assessment, making it interoperable with both GRI and ISSB Standards.

## Why GRI Standards Matter

### Global Adoption and Recognition

GRI Standards are used by over **10,000 organizations** in more than 100 countries, making them the de facto global baseline for sustainability reporting. Key adoption drivers include:

- **Regulatory alignment** — Many jurisdictions reference GRI Standards in sustainability reporting regulations (EU, Singapore, South Africa, Indonesia)
- **Stakeholder expectations** — Investors, customers, employees, and civil society expect GRI-aligned disclosures
- **Supply chain requirements** — Large corporations require suppliers to report using GRI Standards
- **Credibility** — GRI's multi-stakeholder development process ensures balanced perspectives

### Interoperability with Other Frameworks

GRI designed the 2021 Universal Standards to work alongside other reporting frameworks:

| Framework | Relationship with GRI |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **IFRS S1/S2** | Complementary: GRI covers impact materiality, IFRS covers financial materiality |
| **ESRS** | Interoperable: ESRS incorporates GRI structure and many GRI disclosures |
| **SASB** | Compatible: SASB metrics can be reported within GRI Topic Standards |
| **TCFD** | Aligned: GRI 201 (Climate) incorporates TCFD recommendations |
| **TNFD** | Aligned: GRI 304 (Biodiversity) supports TNFD disclosures |
| **UN SDGs** | Mapped: GRI provides SDG mapping for all Topic Standards |

Organizations can use GRI Standards as the foundation and integrate other frameworks for specific disclosure requirements.

## Implementation Guidance

### Step 1: Understand Reporting Principles

GRI 1: Foundation establishes four principles for defining report content:

1. **Stakeholder inclusiveness** — Identify stakeholders and explain how their interests were considered
2. **Sustainability context** — Present performance in the wider context of sustainability challenges
3. **Materiality** — Report on topics that reflect significant economic, environmental, and social impacts
4. **Completeness** — Include sufficient information for stakeholders to assess impacts

And four principles for defining report quality:

1. **Accuracy** — Information must be correct and detailed enough for assessment
2. **Balance** — Reflect both positive and negative aspects of performance
3. **Clarity** — Make information understandable and accessible
4. **Comparability** — Enable comparison over time and with other organizations
5. **Reliability** — Information must be verifiable and gathered through sound processes
6. **Timeliness** — Report on a regular schedule so information is available for decision-making

### Step 2: Determine Material Topics

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 requires a structured process:

**2.1 Understand the organization's context**
- Activities, business relationships, and stakeholders
- Actual and potential impacts across value chain

**2.2 Identify actual and potential impacts**
- Use Sector Standards as starting point (likely material topics)
- Conduct stakeholder engagement (surveys, interviews, workshops)
- Review media, peer reports, and sustainability trends
- Assess impacts across value chain (upstream, operations, downstream)

**2.3 Assess significance of impacts**
- **Negative impacts:** Severity (scale, scope, irremediability)
- **Positive impacts:** Scale and scope
- Likelihood of occurrence

**2.4 Prioritize most significant impacts for reporting**
- Rank impacts by significance
- Determine which impacts constitute material topics
- Document rationale for inclusion/exclusion

**2.5 Disclose material topics**
- List of material topics
- How each topic was determined to be material
- Where impacts occur (value chain location)

### Step 3: Report Using Topic Standards

For each material topic, report using the relevant Topic Standard:

**Management approach** (required for all material topics):
- Policies and commitments
- Actions taken to manage impacts
- Tracking effectiveness of actions

**Topic-specific disclosures** (varies by standard):
- Quantitative metrics (e.g., GHG emissions, water consumption, injury rates)
- Qualitative information (e.g., policies, programs, case studies)

**Example: GRI 305 (Emissions)**
- 305-1: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions
- 305-2: Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions
- 305-3: Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions
- 305-4: GHG emissions intensity
- 305-5: Reduction of GHG emissions
- 305-6: Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODS)
- 305-7: Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and other significant air emissions

### Step 4: Prepare Sustainability Report

GRI 2: General Disclosures requires reporting on:

**Organizational details and reporting practices:**
- Organization name, ownership, legal form
- Location of headquarters and operations
- Reporting period, frequency, and contact point
- Restatements of information and external assurance

**Activities and workers:**
- Activities, value chain, and other business relationships
- Employees and other workers

**Governance:**
- Governance structure and composition
- Nomination and selection of highest governance body
- Chair of highest governance body
- Role in overseeing impact management
- Delegation of responsibility for impact management
- Conflicts of interest
- Communication of critical concerns

**Strategy, policies, and practices:**
- Statement on sustainable development strategy
- Policy commitments
- Embedding policy commitments
- Processes to remediate negative impacts
- Mechanisms for seeking advice and raising concerns

**Stakeholder engagement:**
- Approach to stakeholder engagement
- Collective bargaining agreements

## Regional Implementation

### European Union

The EU's **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)** requires approximately 50,000 companies to report using European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). ESRS was designed to be interoperable with GRI Standards, incorporating many GRI disclosures and using a similar structure. Organizations reporting under ESRS can map disclosures to GRI with minimal additional effort.

### Singapore

The Singapore Exchange (SGX) requires all listed issuers to provide sustainability reports on a "comply or explain" basis, with GRI Standards as the recommended framework. From FY2025, climate-related disclosures aligned with ISSB Standards are mandatory, but GRI remains the preferred framework for broader sustainability reporting.

### South Africa

The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) requires listed companies to produce integrated reports that include sustainability information. GRI Standards are widely used alongside the International Integrated Reporting Framework (IIRF) to meet JSE requirements.
