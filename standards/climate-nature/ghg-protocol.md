# GHG Protocol

The **Greenhouse Gas Protocol** provides the world's most widely used standards for measuring and managing greenhouse gas emissions. Developed by WRI and WBCSD, the GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive frameworks for corporate and product-level emissions accounting.

## Framework Overview

### Corporate Standard

The **Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard** (2004, revised 2015) provides requirements and guidance for companies preparing a corporate-level GHG emissions inventory. It covers **three scopes**:

**Scope 1: Direct Emissions** — Emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company
- Stationary combustion (boilers, furnaces)
- Mobile combustion (company vehicles)
- Process emissions (chemical reactions, industrial processes)
- Fugitive emissions (refrigerants, natural gas leaks)

**Scope 2: Indirect Emissions from Purchased Energy** — Emissions from generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling
- Location-based method (average grid emissions)
- Market-based method (contractual instruments like RECs)

**Scope 3: Other Indirect Emissions** — All other indirect emissions in the value chain (15 categories)
- **Upstream:** Purchased goods/services, capital goods, fuel/energy, transportation, waste, business travel, employee commuting, leased assets
- **Downstream:** Transportation, processing, use of sold products, end-of-life, leased assets, franchises, investments

### Product Standard

The **Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard** (2011) provides requirements for quantifying and publicly reporting a product carbon footprint across its life cycle.

## Why GHG Protocol Matters

### Universal Adoption

The GHG Protocol is used by **92% of Fortune 500 companies** reporting emissions to CDP. It serves as the foundation for:
- **IFRS S2** — Climate-related disclosures
- **ESRS E1** — EU climate reporting
- **CDP** — Climate questionnaire
- **SBTi** — Science-based target setting
- **ISO 14064** — International emissions standard

### Scope 3 Imperative

For most companies, **Scope 3 emissions represent 70-90% of total carbon footprint**. The GHG Protocol's Scope 3 Standard (2011) provides the methodology for measuring value chain emissions, enabling companies to address their full climate impact.
