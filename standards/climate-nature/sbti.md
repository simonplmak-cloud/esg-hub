# SBTi

The **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)** enables companies to set greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets consistent with limiting global warming to **1.5°C** above pre-industrial levels. Over **7,000 companies** have committed to or set science-based targets as of 2025.

## Framework Overview

### Target Validation Criteria

SBTi validates corporate emissions reduction targets against climate science. Targets must meet specific criteria:

**Near-term Targets (5-10 years):**
- **Scope 1+2:** Minimum 42% absolute reduction by 2030 (from base year) for 1.5°C pathway
- **Scope 3:** Required if Scope 3 emissions >40% of total; minimum 25% reduction or 2.5% annual linear reduction

**Long-term Targets (2050):**
- **Net-zero:** Minimum 90% absolute reduction in Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2050
- **Residual emissions:** <10% can be neutralized through carbon removal

### Sector-Specific Pathways

SBTi provides tailored guidance for high-impact sectors:
- **Power generation** — Emissions intensity targets
- **Oil & gas** — Production and product use emissions
- **Aviation** — Efficiency improvements + sustainable aviation fuel
- **Financial institutions** — Portfolio emissions (financed, facilitated, insured)
- **Forest, land, and agriculture (FLAG)** — Land-use emissions and removals

### Net-Zero Standard

The **SBTi Net-Zero Standard** (2021) defines corporate net-zero as:
1. **Reduce** value chain emissions by 90-95% (Scope 1+2+3)
2. **Neutralize** residual emissions through carbon removal (not offsets)
3. **Beyond value chain mitigation** — Finance climate action beyond the value chain

## Why SBTi Matters

### Investor Expectations

Major investors including BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street expect portfolio companies to set science-based targets. **CDP** awards higher scores to companies with validated SBTi targets.

### Regulatory Alignment

SBTi targets demonstrate compliance with emerging climate regulations:
- **CSRD/ESRS E1** — Transition plan requirements
- **UK TPT** — Transition Plan Taskforce expectations
- **California SB 253** — Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act

### Credibility

SBTi validation provides **third-party verification** that targets are ambitious enough to limit warming to 1.5°C, differentiating science-based targets from aspirational commitments.
