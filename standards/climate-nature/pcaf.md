# PCAF

The **Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)** provides the global standard for measuring and disclosing greenhouse gas emissions associated with loans and investments. Over **450 financial institutions** with **$96 trillion in assets** use PCAF to measure financed emissions.

## Framework Overview

PCAF methodology covers **7 asset classes**: Listed equity and corporate bonds, Business loans and unlisted equity, Project finance, Commercial real estate, Mortgages, Motor vehicle loans, and Sovereign debt.

### Attribution Approach

PCAF uses an **attribution factor** to allocate portfolio company emissions:

**Attribution Factor** = Outstanding Amount / (Enterprise Value + Debt)  
**Financed Emissions** = Portfolio Company Emissions × Attribution Factor

### Data Quality Score

PCAF assigns a **data quality score (1-5)** to each holding based on data source reliability.

## Why PCAF Matters

Financial institutions face increasing requirements to disclose financed emissions under IFRS S2, ESRS E1, and proposed SEC rules. PCAF enables portfolio decarbonization and science-based target setting for financial institutions.
