# SBTN

The **Science Based Targets Network (SBTN)** provides methods for companies to set science-based targets for nature, complementing SBTi's climate targets. SBTN's **AR3T framework** (Avoid, Reduce, Regenerate & Restore, Transform) guides corporate action on nature across freshwater, land, ocean, and biodiversity.

## Framework Overview

SBTN targets address **five environmental systems**: Climate (via SBTi), Freshwater, Land, Ocean, and Biodiversity. Companies follow a **5-step process**:

**Step 1: Assess** — Identify material environmental issues and value chain impacts  
**Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize** — Determine which issues require targets  
**Step 3: Measure, Set & Disclose** — Establish science-based targets  
**Step 4: Act** — Implement action plans using AR3T framework  
**Step 5: Track** — Monitor and report progress

### AR3T Action Framework

**Avoid** — Prevent new harm to nature (highest priority)  
**Reduce** — Minimize ongoing negative impacts  
**Regenerate & Restore** — Improve degraded ecosystems  
**Transform** — Shift business models and value chains toward nature-positive outcomes

## Why SBTN Matters

SBTN targets enable companies to address the **nature crisis** with the same rigor as climate targets. With **1 million species at risk of extinction** and ecosystem degradation accelerating, SBTN provides the methodology for corporate nature action aligned with planetary boundaries.
