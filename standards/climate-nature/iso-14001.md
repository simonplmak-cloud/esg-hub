# ISO 14001

**ISO 14001:2015** specifies requirements for an environmental management system (EMS) that organizations can use to enhance environmental performance. Over **400,000 organizations** worldwide are certified to ISO 14001.

## Framework Overview

ISO 14001 follows the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** cycle for continuous improvement:

**Plan** — Establish environmental objectives and processes  
**Do** — Implement the processes  
**Check** — Monitor and measure processes  
**Act** — Take actions to continually improve

## Why ISO 14001 Matters

ISO 14001 certification demonstrates systematic environmental management and regulatory compliance. Many companies require suppliers to be ISO 14001 certified.
