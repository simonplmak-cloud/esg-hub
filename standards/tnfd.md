# TNFD

The **Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)** provides a risk management and disclosure framework for organizations to report and act on evolving nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. Released in September 2023, the TNFD framework mirrors the structure of TCFD while addressing the unique complexities of nature-related issues across biodiversity, ecosystems, and natural capital.

## Framework Overview

TNFD adopts the same four-pillar structure as TCFD (Governance, Strategy, Risk & Impact Management, Metrics & Targets), integrating all 11 TCFD-recommended disclosures by substituting references to "climate" with "nature." This design enables organizations to integrate nature-related disclosures into existing climate reporting processes.

The **LEAP approach** (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) provides a structured process for identifying and assessing nature-related issues across the value chain.

## Why TNFD Matters

Nature loss poses systemic risks to the global economy. The World Economic Forum estimates that **$44 trillion of economic value generation** (more than half of global GDP) is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. The IPBES Global Assessment (2019) found that **1 million species are threatened with extinction**.

As of 2025, over **500 organizations** have committed to adopting TNFD recommendations, and regulatory requirements are emerging in the EU (ESRS E4), UK (SDR), and other jurisdictions.
