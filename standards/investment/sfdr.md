# SFDR

The **EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)** requires financial market participants to disclose sustainability information about investment products.

## Framework Overview

**Article 6: Other Funds** — No specific sustainability focus  
**Article 8: Light Green Funds** — Promote environmental or social characteristics  
**Article 9: Dark Green Funds** — Have sustainable investment as their objective

SFDR requires disclosure of **18 mandatory Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) indicators** covering climate, environment, social, and governance issues.

## Why SFDR Matters

SFDR creates **transparency** in sustainable investing, enabling investors to distinguish genuinely sustainable funds from greenwashing. Over **€4 trillion** in assets are classified as Article 8 or 9 funds.
