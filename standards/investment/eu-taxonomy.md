# EU Taxonomy

The **EU Taxonomy** is a classification system establishing which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable.

## Framework Overview

An activity is taxonomy-aligned if it makes a **substantial contribution** to at least one of six environmental objectives while doing **no significant harm (DNSH)** to the others:

1. Climate change mitigation  
2. Climate change adaptation  
3. Sustainable use of water and marine resources  
4. Transition to a circular economy  
5. Pollution prevention and control  
6. Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems

Under CSRD, companies must disclose % of turnover, CapEx, and OpEx that is taxonomy-aligned.

## Why EU Taxonomy Matters

The Taxonomy provides a **common language** for sustainable finance, enabling investors to identify genuinely green investments and companies to demonstrate environmental credentials.
