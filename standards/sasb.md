# SASB

The **Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards** provide industry-specific guidance on financially material sustainability topics. Now maintained by the IFRS Foundation alongside IFRS S1/S2, SASB Standards cover **77 industries** across 11 sectors, identifying the ESG issues most likely to affect enterprise value in each industry.

## Framework Overview

SASB Standards use **financial materiality** as the basis for determining which sustainability topics companies should disclose. Each industry standard identifies 3-8 material topics from a universe of 26 general ESG issues.

### 11 Sectors Covered

1. **Consumer Goods** — Apparel, household products, toys
2. **Extractives & Minerals Processing** — Oil & gas, metals & mining
3. **Financials** — Banks, insurance, asset management
4. **Food & Beverage** — Agriculture, restaurants, beverages
5. **Health Care** — Biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, healthcare delivery
6. **Infrastructure** — Electric utilities, water utilities, waste management
7. **Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy** — Biofuels, solar, wind
8. **Resource Transformation** — Chemicals, construction materials, paper
9. **Services** — Advertising, education, hotels & lodging
10. **Technology & Communications** — Hardware, software, telecommunications
11. **Transportation** — Airlines, automobiles, rail

### 26 General ESG Issues

SASB organizes sustainability topics into **5 dimensions**:

**Environment:** GHG emissions, air quality, energy management, water & wastewater, waste & hazardous materials, ecological impacts

**Social Capital:** Human rights & community relations, customer privacy, data security, access & affordability, product quality & safety, customer welfare, selling practices & product labeling

**Human Capital:** Labor practices, employee health & safety, employee engagement diversity & inclusion

**Business Model & Innovation:** Product design & lifecycle management, business model resilience, supply chain management, materials sourcing & efficiency, physical impacts of climate change

**Leadership & Governance:** Business ethics, competitive behavior, management of legal & regulatory environment, critical incident risk management, systemic risk management

## Why SASB Matters

### Investor Focus

SASB Standards were developed with **significant investor input** to focus on financially material information. Over **2,700 organizations** globally use SASB Standards, including major asset managers like BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard.

### IFRS Integration

In 2022, SASB merged with the IFRS Foundation. SASB Standards now serve as the **industry-specific guidance** for IFRS S1 General Requirements. Companies reporting under IFRS S1/S2 are expected to reference SASB Standards for their industry.

### Comparability

SASB's industry-specific approach enables **peer comparison** — investors can compare sustainability performance across companies in the same industry using standardized metrics.
