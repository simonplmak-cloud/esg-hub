# Social (S) Resources

Resources organized by **Stakeholder Theory Framework** (Freeman, 1984).

Stakeholder theory posits that companies must manage relationships with all stakeholders—not just shareholders—including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and society at large. This framework provides the most comprehensive and widely accepted theoretical foundation for the Social dimension of ESG.

**Framework Origin**: Freeman, R. E. (1984). *Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach*. Boston: Pitman.  
**Key Principle**: "Companies create value by managing relationships with stakeholders whose interests are affected by corporate activities."

---

## Framework Overview

The Social dimension is organized into **five core stakeholder categories**, each representing critical relationships that companies must manage for long-term value creation:

| Category | Primary Stakeholders | Key ESG Standards | Status |
|:---------|:---------------------|:------------------|:-------|
| 👷 Human Capital & Labor | Employees, workers | GRI 401-406, SASB | Material for all sectors |
| ⚖️ Human Rights | Workers, communities, society | GRI 408-414, UNGP | Increasing materiality |
| 🛡️ Product Responsibility | Customers, end-users | GRI 416-418, SASB | Sector-specific |
