# Environmental (E) Resources

Resources organized by the **Planetary Boundaries Framework** (Rockström et al., Stockholm Resilience Centre).

The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on nine critical Earth system processes. Six of nine boundaries have been transgressed, indicating that Earth is now well outside the safe operating space for humanity.

**Framework Origin**: Rockström, J., et al. (2009). "A safe operating space for humanity." Nature, 461, 472-475.  
**Updated**: Steffen, W., et al. (2015). "Planetary boundaries: Guiding human development on a changing planet." Science, 347(6223), 1259855.

## Why Planetary Boundaries?

### Scientific Rigor
The planetary boundaries framework is grounded in Earth system science and represents the consensus of leading climate and environmental scientists.

### Comprehensive Coverage
The nine boundaries capture the full range of environmental pressures on Earth systems, from climate to biodiversity to chemical pollution.

### Clear Thresholds
Each boundary defines a quantitative threshold beyond which risks increase significantly. This provides clear targets for corporate action.

### Integration with ESG
The framework aligns with and complements major ESG standards (TNFD, IFRS S2, GRI), providing a scientific foundation for environmental reporting.
