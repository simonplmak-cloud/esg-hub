# South Korea ESG Regulations

South Korea has introduced **mandatory ESG disclosure** for listed companies and is implementing **K-Taxonomy** (Korean Green Classification System) to guide sustainable finance.

## Regulatory Framework

**Financial Services Commission (FSC)** — ESG disclosure regulations  
**Korea Exchange (KRX)** — Listing requirements  
**Ministry of Environment** — K-Taxonomy and environmental regulations

### Key Requirements

**Mandatory ESG Reports** — Required for KOSPI companies from 2025  
**K-IFRS Sustainability Standards** — Aligned with ISSB IFRS S1 and S2  
**K-Taxonomy** — Classification of environmentally sustainable activities

## K-Taxonomy

The **Korean Green Classification System** defines green activities across six environmental objectives, similar to EU Taxonomy:

1. Greenhouse gas reduction  
2. Climate change adaptation  
3. Sustainable water management  
4. Circular economy transition  
5. Pollution prevention  
6. Biodiversity protection

## Why Korea ESG Matters

South Korea is the world's **10th-largest economy** with major global corporations (Samsung, Hyundai, LG). Korea's ESG regulations influence global supply chains and technology sectors.
