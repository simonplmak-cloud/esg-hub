# Australia ESG Requirements

Australia is introducing **mandatory climate-related financial disclosures** from 2025, aligned with ISSB standards, making it one of the first countries to mandate IFRS S1 and S2.

## Regulatory Framework

**Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)** — Corporate disclosure oversight  
**Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB)** — Sustainability reporting standards  
**Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)** — Climate risk for financial institutions

### Key Requirements (From 2025)

**Mandatory Climate Disclosure** — IFRS S1 and S2 for large companies  
**Phased Implementation** — Based on company size and sector  
**Assurance Requirements** — Limited assurance initially, reasonable assurance from 2030

## Implementation Timeline

**Group 1 (FY 2025):** ASX 200 companies, large financials  
**Group 2 (FY 2026):** Other large companies  
**Group 3 (FY 2027):** Medium-sized companies

## Why Australia ESG Matters

Australia is a major **resources exporter** and early adopter of mandatory climate disclosure. The regulations will significantly impact mining, energy, and agricultural sectors globally.
