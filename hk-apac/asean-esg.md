# ASEAN ESG Frameworks

The **Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)** has developed regional frameworks to harmonize ESG disclosure and promote sustainable finance across member states.

## Key Frameworks

**ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance** — Classification system for green activities  
**ASEAN Green Bond Standards** — Standards for green bond issuance  
**ASEAN Social Bond Standards** — Standards for social bond issuance  
**ASEAN Sustainability Bond Standards** — Standards for sustainability bonds

### ASEAN Taxonomy

The ASEAN Taxonomy provides a **common language** for sustainable finance across 10 member states, covering:

**Foundation Framework** — Principles and criteria for all sectors  
**Plus Standard** — Additional criteria for specific countries  
**Tiered Approach** — Green, amber, red classification

## Member State Implementation

Each ASEAN member state implements ESG requirements at different paces:

**Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand** — Advanced ESG disclosure requirements  
**Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam** — Developing ESG frameworks  
**Others** — Early-stage ESG regulation

## Why ASEAN ESG Matters

ASEAN represents a **$3.6 trillion economy** with **680 million people**. Harmonized ESG standards facilitate cross-border investment and sustainable development in the region.
