# Japan ESG Regulations

Japan has integrated ESG considerations into corporate governance through the **Corporate Governance Code** and mandated **TCFD-aligned climate disclosures** for Prime Market companies.

## Regulatory Framework

**Financial Services Agency (FSA)** — Corporate disclosure regulations  
**Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)** — Listing requirements and Corporate Governance Code  
**Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)** — Climate transition policy

### Key Requirements

**TCFD Disclosure** — Mandatory for Prime Market companies (largest listings)  
**Corporate Governance Code** — Principle 3.1 requires sustainability disclosure  
**Integrated Reporting** — Encouraged for all listed companies

## Corporate Governance Code

The Code requires companies to disclose:
- **Sustainability initiatives** including ESG factors  
- **Climate-related risks and opportunities** (TCFD framework)  
- **Human capital management** strategies  
- **Diversity** in board composition

## Why Japan ESG Matters

Japan is the world's **third-largest economy** with sophisticated capital markets. TSE's Prime Market includes over **1,800 companies**, making Japan a leader in mandatory climate disclosure in Asia.
