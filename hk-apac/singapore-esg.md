# Singapore ESG Requirements

The **Singapore Exchange (SGX)** requires listed companies to publish sustainability reports on a **comply or explain** basis, aligned with international standards.

## Framework Overview

**SGX Sustainability Reporting Rules** mandate disclosure based on:

- **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards** (primary framework)  
- **TCFD recommendations** for climate-related disclosures  
- **ISSB Standards** (phased adoption from 2025)

### Reporting Requirements

**Annual Sustainability Report** — Must be published within 5 months of financial year-end  
**Board Statement** — Board oversight of sustainability matters  
**Material ESG Factors** — Identification and disclosure of material topics  
**Targets & Performance** — Sustainability targets and progress

## Climate Disclosure

From 2025, SGX will require **climate-related disclosures** aligned with ISSB IFRS S2 for all listed companies, with phased implementation for Scope 3 emissions.

## Why Singapore ESG Matters

Singapore is a major **financial hub** in Asia with over **700 listed companies**. SGX's requirements influence regional ESG practices and attract sustainable investment.
