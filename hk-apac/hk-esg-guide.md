# Hong Kong ESG Reporting Guide

The **Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) ESG Reporting Guide** sets mandatory ESG disclosure requirements for all listed companies. Updated in 2024, the Guide aligns with international standards including ISSB and TCFD.

## Framework Overview

The Guide is structured around **two subject areas**:

**Subject Area A: Environmental** — Emissions, Resources, Environment & Natural Resources, Climate Change  
**Subject Area B: Social** — Employment, Health & Safety, Development & Training, Labour Standards, Supply Chain, Product Responsibility, Anti-corruption, Community

### Reporting Requirements

**Mandatory Disclosure Requirements (MDRs)** — Must disclose or explain non-disclosure  
**Recommended Disclosures (RDs)** — Encouraged but not mandatory  
**Comply or Explain** — Companies must comply with all MDRs or explain why not

## Key Updates (2024)

- **Climate-related disclosures** aligned with ISSB IFRS S2  
- **Scope 3 GHG emissions** disclosure required (phased approach)  
- **Biodiversity** considerations added  
- **Enhanced governance** requirements

## Why HK ESG Guide Matters
