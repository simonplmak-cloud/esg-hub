# Materiality Assessment

A **materiality assessment** identifies and prioritizes ESG topics that are most significant to a company's business and stakeholders.

## Double Materiality

**Financial Materiality** — ESG issues that affect enterprise value (IFRS S1/S2, SASB)  
**Impact Materiality** — Company's impacts on environment and society (GRI, ESRS)

The **EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)** requires **double materiality** assessment covering both perspectives.

## Materiality Assessment Process

### Step 1: Identify ESG Topics

Review industry-specific ESG topics from frameworks like SASB Materiality Map, GRI Sector Standards, and peer company reports.

### Step 2: Engage Stakeholders

Conduct surveys, interviews, and workshops with:
- Investors and analysts  
- Employees  
- Customers and suppliers  
- Local communities  
- Regulators

### Step 3: Assess Significance

Rate each topic on two dimensions:
- **Significance to stakeholders** (Impact materiality)  
- **Financial impact on company** (Financial materiality)

### Step 4: Prioritize and Validate

Create a **materiality matrix** plotting topics by significance. Validate with senior management and board.

### Step 5: Review Annually

Materiality changes over time. Review and update assessment annually.

## Common Material Topics by Sector

**Financial Services:** Data security, responsible lending, financial inclusion  
**Manufacturing:** GHG emissions, waste management, worker safety  
**Technology:** Data privacy, energy consumption, supply chain labor  
**Retail:** Supply chain sustainability, product safety, labor practices
