# ESG Assurance & Verification

**ESG assurance** provides independent verification of ESG disclosures, enhancing credibility and stakeholder trust.

## Types of Assurance

**Limited Assurance** — Review procedures, negative assurance ("nothing came to our attention")  
**Reasonable Assurance** — Audit procedures, positive assurance ("in our opinion, fairly stated")

Most ESG assurance is currently **limited assurance**. Regulations increasingly require **reasonable assurance** for key metrics.

## Assurance Standards

**ISAE 3000** — International Standard on Assurance Engagements (general purpose)  
**ISAE 3410** — Assurance on greenhouse gas statements  
**AA1000AS** — AccountAbility Assurance Standard (stakeholder-focused)

## What Gets Assured?

**Commonly Assured:**
- GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, sometimes 3)  
- Energy consumption  
- Water usage  
- Waste generation  
- Health and safety statistics

**Increasingly Assured:**
- Climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD)  
- Sustainability reports (full or selected disclosures)  
- Supply chain data

## Assurance Process

### 1. Planning

Define **scope** (which disclosures), **level** (limited or reasonable), and **criteria** (reporting standards).

### 2. Risk Assessment

Identify areas of **material misstatement risk** based on data complexity and controls.

### 3. Evidence Gathering

**Inquiry** — Interview data owners  
**Inspection** — Review documentation and systems  
**Observation** — Visit facilities  
**Recalculation** — Verify calculations  
**Analytical Procedures** — Compare trends

### 4. Reporting

Issue **assurance statement** describing scope, procedures, findings, and conclusion.

## Choosing an Assurance Provider

**Big Four Accounting Firms** — PwC, Deloitte, EY, KPMG (financial audit expertise)  
**Specialist ESG Firms** — ERM, DNV, SGS (technical ESG expertise)  
**Industry Certifiers** — Sector-specific verification bodies

## Regulatory Requirements

**EU CSRD** — Reasonable assurance required (phased from 2028)  
**California Climate Disclosure** — Third-party assurance required  
**SEC Climate Rule (proposed)** — Attestation for Scope 1 & 2 emissions
