# ESG Fundamentals

**Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.

## The Three Pillars

**Environmental (E)** — Climate change, resource depletion, waste, pollution, deforestation  
**Social (S)** — Working conditions, local communities, diversity & inclusion, human rights  
**Governance (G)** — Board composition, audit practices, executive pay, shareholder rights, anti-corruption

## Why ESG Matters

**Risk Management** — ESG factors represent material financial risks  
**Investor Demand** — $35 trillion in global ESG assets (2024)  
**Regulatory Requirements** — Mandatory ESG disclosure in major markets  
**Stakeholder Expectations** — Customers, employees, communities demand sustainability

## ESG vs CSR vs Sustainability

**ESG** — Measurable factors for investment analysis  
**CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)** — Voluntary initiatives beyond legal requirements  
**Sustainability** — Broader concept of long-term environmental and social viability

## Getting Started with ESG

1. **Understand materiality** — Identify ESG issues relevant to your industry  
2. **Choose a framework** — Select reporting standards (GRI, SASB, IFRS)  
3. **Collect data** — Establish systems for ESG data collection  
4. **Set targets** — Define measurable ESG goals  
5. **Report transparently** — Disclose progress and challenges
