# ESG Data Management

Effective **ESG data management** is critical for accurate reporting, regulatory compliance, and decision-making.

## ESG Data Challenges

**Data Availability** — ESG data often not collected systematically  
**Data Quality** — Inconsistent definitions and measurement methods  
**Data Silos** — ESG data scattered across departments  
**Scope 3 Complexity** — Supply chain data difficult to obtain  
**Assurance Requirements** — Increasing demand for verified data

## ESG Data Management Framework

### 1. Data Governance

Establish **clear ownership** for ESG data:
- Assign data stewards for each ESG metric  
- Define data quality standards  
- Create data collection procedures  
- Implement approval workflows

### 2. Data Collection Systems

**Manual Collection** — Spreadsheets and surveys (small companies)  
**ERP Integration** — Extract ESG data from existing systems  
**ESG Software Platforms** — Dedicated ESG data management tools  
**IoT Sensors** — Real-time environmental monitoring

### 3. Data Quality Controls

**Validation Rules** — Automated checks for data completeness and accuracy  
**Reconciliation** — Cross-check data across sources  
**Audit Trails** — Document data sources and calculations  
**Third-Party Verification** — Independent assurance of key metrics

### 4. Data Storage and Access

**Centralized Database** — Single source of truth for ESG data  
**Role-Based Access** — Control who can view and edit data  
**Version Control** — Track changes over time  
**API Integration** — Enable data sharing with reporting platforms
