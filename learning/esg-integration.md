# ESG Integration in Investment

**ESG integration** is the systematic inclusion of ESG factors in investment analysis and decision-making.

## ESG Integration vs Other Approaches

**ESG Integration** — Incorporate material ESG factors into financial analysis  
**Negative Screening** — Exclude certain sectors (tobacco, weapons)  
**Positive Screening** — Select best-in-class ESG performers  
**Impact Investing** — Invest for measurable social/environmental impact  
**Thematic Investing** — Focus on sustainability themes (clean energy, water)

## Why ESG Integration Matters

**Risk Management** — ESG factors represent material financial risks  
**Performance** — Academic evidence shows ESG integration improves risk-adjusted returns  
**Fiduciary Duty** — Regulators increasingly view ESG as part of fiduciary responsibility  
**Client Demand** — Institutional and retail investors demand ESG integration

## ESG Integration Process

**ESG Data Providers** — MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics, ISS ESG, Bloomberg ESG  
**Company Disclosures** — Sustainability reports, CDP responses, proxy statements  
**Third-Party Research** — NGO reports, academic studies, media analysis

### 2. Materiality Assessment

Identify **financially material ESG factors** for each sector using frameworks like SASB Materiality Map.

### 3. ESG Analysis

**Quantitative Analysis** — ESG scores, carbon intensity, diversity metrics  
**Qualitative Analysis** — Management quality, governance practices, stakeholder relations  
**Scenario Analysis** — Climate transition scenarios, regulatory changes

### 4. Investment Decision

**Valuation Adjustment** — Adjust DCF assumptions for ESG risks/opportunities  
**Risk Rating** — Incorporate ESG into credit or equity risk models  
**Portfolio Construction** — Optimize for financial and ESG objectives

### 5. Active Ownership

**Engagement** — Dialogue with companies on ESG issues  
**Proxy Voting** — Vote on ESG-related shareholder proposals  
**Collaboration** — Join investor initiatives (Climate Action 100+, CA100+)

## ESG Integration by Asset Class

**Fixed Income** — ESG-adjusted credit ratings, green bonds  
**Private Equity** — ESG due diligence, value creation through ESG improvements  
**Real Estate** — Green building certifications, energy efficiency, tenant engagement

## Measuring ESG Integration Effectiveness
