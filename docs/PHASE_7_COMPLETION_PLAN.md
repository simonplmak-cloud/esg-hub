## Risk Management

### Potential Delays

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Complex topics require more research | Medium | +2-3 hours | Prioritize primary sources, use framework guidance |
| Technical issues (API limits, connectivity) | Low | +1-2 hours | Work offline when possible, batch commits |
| Quality concerns require rework | Low | +2-4 hours | Follow content template strictly, peer review |
| Scope creep (adding new pages) | Medium | +variable | Lock scope at 105 pages, document future additions |

### Contingency Plan

If timeline extends beyond 4 days:
1. **Priority 1:** Complete Milestones 1-2 (Standards + HK/APAC) - 25 pages
2. **Priority 2:** Complete Milestone 5 (Social High Priority) - 20 pages
3. **Priority 3:** Complete remaining milestones in order

This ensures highest-value content is completed first if time constraints emerge.
